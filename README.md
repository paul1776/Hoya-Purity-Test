# Hoya-Purity-Test

## Background
This project built a "purity test" modeled on the Rice Purity Test, but with some changes to reflect Georgetown. 

From March to July 2019, this project was hosted at https://hoyapuritytest.xyz

## How it works 

The main parts of the website are built in HTML, with some limited CSS formatting (this is quite limited to conserve an appearance most smilar to the barebones Rice test). JavaScript was used for the animations and to build functionality. 

## Acknowledgements
This project was imagined, planned and built with Kelly Thomas.
